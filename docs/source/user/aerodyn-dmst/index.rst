DMST User's Guide and Theory Manual
===================================

.. only:: html

   This document serves as a reference for the double multiple streamtube (DMST) submodule included in the AeroDyn module of OpenFAST. The DMST submodule is intended to be used in conjunction with the \**AeroDyn driver\** for vertical-axis turbine modeling. This manual will be updated as new features are added and as needed to provide further information about the software.

   The implementation plan for this feature can be accessed here: :download:`(DMST Implementation Plan) <downloads/DMST_Implementation_Plan.pdf>`.
